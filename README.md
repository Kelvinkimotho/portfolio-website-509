## 🚀 Collaboration Workflow

To ensure a smooth collaboration, we followed this workflow:

1. **Planning Phase**  
   - Define structure and wireframes.
   - Divide sections among team members.

2. **Development Phase**  
   - Create separate branches for features (e.g., `navbar-feature`, `about-me-page`).
   - Code cleanly with proper HTML5 semantic elements.
   - Comment code clearly for easier collaboration.

3. **Git Workflow**  
   - Pull the latest changes before starting (`git pull origin main`).
   - Create a new branch for each feature (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
   - Commit changes often with descriptive messages.
   - Push branches to GitHub (`git push origin feature-name`).
   - Create Pull Requests (PR) and request code reviews.
   - Merge changes into the `main` branch after approval.

4. **Testing Phase**  
   - Cross-browser and mobile testing.
   - Peer review and feedback sessions.

5. **Submission**  
   - Final GitHub repository submitted via the provided Google Form.
